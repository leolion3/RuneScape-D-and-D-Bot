# Rune Goldberg Notifier

This module notifies you of the rune combination for the [Rune of Goldberg Machine](https://runescape.wiki/w/Rune_Goldberg_Machine),
ensuring you always get the maximum amount of vis wax possible.

Notifications are sent out at 6 AM CET to ensure that the community has had enough time to figure out the rune combinations.
